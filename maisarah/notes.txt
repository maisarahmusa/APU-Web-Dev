External hyperlink:

a tag - anchor - bring to another page
<a href="https:/blabla.com">edX Website </a>
href = link (target source to go)

Internal hyperlink:
<a href="#coolElement">edX Website </a>

If it clicks, it would go to that section. It will give in 'id' on the same page.

<div class="coolElement"
    content
</div>

Hyperlink Targets:
    target is an attribute.
    target = when hyperlink clicks, it would go to the another page (new window).
    as for : <base target="_blank"> all the links inside of the page will pop-out to the new window.

14 February 2023 (Tuesday)
use div to set the container
semantic web (old-way) only support on html file
-use less div
- header: logo, some information text (at the top)
-aside: advertising
- section : the page content
- article : can have more paragraph
- aside: right/left side
- footer: copyright info (below)
- ol order list
- li by default: 1. 2. 3.
- ul - bullet points (add style using circle, page: 10)

<picture> 
optional by stating source = min-width
</picture>

media: targetted devices

Basic Table
expand the col and row
 first row always be table header

 tfoot 

 caption normally at the top of the table

 16 Feb 2023
 method POST and GET (Form)
 sensitive info should be encrypted

 button 
 submit - method POST (getting the form and submit)- Validation Form
 function of js - to validate form (encode it and submit to...)
 validation: carry at the server side
 disabled - cannot use lah
 submit button should be put inside of the form.
 action = bla bla, bla bla = server script
 enctype = encoding type would transmit to mana mana (server)

 radio button - only one option
 checkbox - multiple choice

INPUT
 placeholder - will display in grey
 required - mandatory
 email - cannot submit until insert in a proper email/format (validate)
 The message is the standard one (takleh ubah, kalau nk ubah pakai JS)
 name="" -> parameter name

 the server script get one by one... and process the data
 no name = difficult to extract the data

 internal style
 -edit in head

 CSS Syntax Style
 1) Selectors -
 eg: html elements
 table, th, td {

 }
 2) Declaration (rule)
 - consists of property & values
 - always end with semicolon

 right-side: property
 left-side: value

 padding - can't use equal / =

 inline style

 h1 - html style
 rule - put semicolon


 Embedded style:
 use if 1 single page
 -used in style elements and inside of <head>

 External:
 - Naming of docs: 123.css (Extension file)
 - No <style>
 - just pure CSS

 Multiple Style Rules
 - recommend to use combination
 - inline & internal style

 if use 
 1) css style inside of <style> internal style use for tht page

 and

 2) <h1 style="llala">Heading1</h1> - inline style (very unique)

 it will take the unique one (which is 2nd one)

 cth nk tukar background: jgn guna inline style, better guna internal style

 kalau guna juga, kena tukar setiap style dalam inline style

 -inline style - last choice (if has special case, then use it.)
 -better to use internal or external style


 Rule sets 
 two rules:
 class - a group of elements
 # - for id - find a single item..
 starts with opening curly brackets

 div>ul>li*6 (shortcut)

 font type {font1, font2, font3}

 1st font: install in machine (the browser looks for this first)
 2nd font:
 3rd font:

if first option is not in the machine, it will read the second option of font and so on

kalau letak external style dgn inline style: page akan baca inline style (unique) - multiple style
 
 code akan baca..
 if
 1- inline
if else
 2- internal
 else
 3- External


ID & Class

select multiple elements - use comma to seperate them
+ symbol must be immediate

header > nav: nested

<header>
    <nav>..</nav>
<header>

draggable attr = true 

if style
header[draggable=true]{
    blabla
}

if draggable= true, then the style would applied to that code mehh..

<header draggable="true">
    Target
</header>

if h2+p{}, it will change all the h2 and p lah
kalau nak selected heading dgn paragraphs shj = guna id

CSS Box Model
- All html elements are boxes
- contoh P tag
- p is a box, then the content is inside of p tag
- outside of the content is a border
- outer one is a margin
- identify the property to style the box
- image is also a tag
- if tak set width, automatik page auto-fit bagi 100%

Border style
border-width property
p.b{

}
.b = class because of dot.

border-radius jdi melengkung dkt bucu

asterisk - to show all elements (semua kotak)
css margins
properties:
clockwise - border n padding
top, right, bottom, left

padding tu saiz border dgn huruf


Nesting elements
> symbol: immediate child

text color
3 types:
text-indent: space for paragraph
line-height - for double spa


whitespace - wrapped content (normal)
nowrap - no content wrapped
ellipsis - content jadi ...

23/2/2023
Group and Nesting:

<main>
<p>
...1st element of main
</p>

<p>
...2nd element of main (p element with child)
<a href =""> - anchor tag = child
</p>

<p>
...3rd element of main
</p>
</main>

nested can be layer by layer

main >a{
    means select all anchor
}

p >a {
    a is a children of p
}

indented spaces (normally a Nesting)
<div>
    <article>...1</article>
    <article>...2</article>
    <div>
        <article>...3</article>
    </div>
    <article>...4</article>
</div>

use space:
#linear-container article{
 to apply all articles in nesting element
}

Property:
1) Font Family
-suggested: normal fonts
responsive font-size
-vw = view width (according adjusted using the devices - screensize)
-font-variant: normal size

Own font- download own font
@font-face {
    src:url - the source of the download
}

article{

}

Dimension
adjust the size of the elements
height - based on content

Position
1) Logo (image tag)
eg: position: float; (property)
final location

eg: advertising while scrolling up and down

Relative:
-

Absolute:
- based on the position of their ancestor element

Fixed:


Overlapping:
layer by layer
if index is larger, then it will be at the top (max value:999, eg: GIF)
............smaller,.......................lowest.


z-index

pseudo-element
-specifies space 
-eg: news update (small icon)
cth space sebelum h1 for <h1>...</h1>

Display Property
-display the behaviour (box model)
-child element
some elements are independent

none - disappear
inline - 

html table cannot fit the content
but the column can 
adjust based on screen resolution (responsive website)

for table, if the screen becomes small, it will turn to scroll horizontally.
~the beauty of css table~ kata pujangga instructor kim

Visiblity property (early version property) - limitation
visible = show
hidden = hide (but still remain on the content, cannot change to another)
-remaining content cannot take over the places 
-can use z-index to overlap (mcm tampal lah mai)

Media Queries
1) when resize the window, the element will followed by the 
specifies max-width
2) as the browser detects the screensize, it will change the 
bcground color (cth nota)
- depends on the targetted devices (mobile/tab)

2 Mar 2023
Javascript
- to improve user's experience
- work together with html n css
- makes more flexible
- hosted at server (advanced js = nodejs)
- Internet Explorer changed into Microsoft Edge
-

2) server replied to the user
3) when the server accepts request, the page contains html, css, js (external/internal) -loads the desired page
4) the doc will be downloaded from server to the clients machine (client machine runs the content)
5) php lang runs at the server

Advantage of Javascript:
- some of the task can be done locally
- server will process
- less load on a server (server is not busy)
- provide instant request
- if internet is not stable, resulting ..
- browser is more interative

3 ways to write JS (the code is different)
1) Inline
    - not recommended (difficult to find when maintenance)
    - if it is a special case, then use it but not too many lah...
2) Embedded
    - using script tag <script>...</script>
    - can include in both head and body section

3) External
    - try to practice by using embedded first to see either it functions or not.
    - if it functions, then pass it to the external script.

- extension.js (anynames.js)

Data types
1) number
2) big int - can store in big numbers
3) string - single quotation ("", '', boleh pakai)
4) backtick `string` (it's not a single quote)
5) ${...} = variable
6) console log = will display the message of the variable by using backtick
7) 

Data type
1) Boolean - 
2) null value -
3) undefined val -

string
- keep track of the words
- concatenation (combination)
- function of variable = to hold the value
- can use 'let' or 'var' keyword


innerscope


naming variable
- symbol
- _
- digits
- letter

FIRST CHARACTER IS NOT ALLOWED TO USE DIGIT

windows.console.log() - windows Feature - 
to confirm (confirm feature)
window prompt - variable call name - pop-up boxes


Javascript
7 MARCH 2023
constant - data: value cannot be changed/reassigned
array - to store multiple data values
operator - 
control structure:
1: Looping Control

ex.30:
issue from prompt
check datatype - typeof operator
console.log(typeof temp)

Working with number
Conditional control
if-else statement
switch case

Break statement: control the statement
Continue statement: always in a Looping
Switch: the value of expression will match to the case.
if the case does not match, it will go to the default.

case..break. if the case is matched, then it would stop from finding
the case. break the control

loop = repeat the same action again n again
for loop
length is length of the elements
i++ = i+1

let = initialization

do while loop
then condition will ask to continue or not

for in loop

function

function abc()
inside of bracker - define a parameter (if any)
callbacks function
anonymous function

i/p parameter: to hold the parameter'

8 MARCH 2023
parseInt function - convert string to int (no)

Function argument
- accept one argument

-i/p param = msg
-i/p argument = hello world

result return keyword

return string with msg

Part 2
window = an object
window navigator
document is an object
getElementid = HTML element/ html text 
innertext = the content

1. window object
2. document object

Window location

window screen = to detect the screensize
id must be unique = getElementid (tht's why tkde s)
backtick `...` = string formatter

window document
.innerhtml = p1_text
p1_text is a content

links array: store inside array list
getElementsByAnything = return the array
document.querySelector() - select the element

Handling Event
button onclick = 

event bubbling =
div1 contains sub div2 container

9/3/2023
Handling Exceptions

try catch
-potential of..

finally statement

throw always inside of catch
the browser catch it

if it is true, then it will skip the throw part

14/3/2023
jQuery-
provide some functions
-much more flexible
AngularJs - MVW model-view-whatever
Saas - can have nested rules 
Saas eg: nav {
    ul{
        ...
    }
}

always starting from lowercase = naming convention (js)
noscript = if user cannot run js in their browser (provide message to them by usinh noscript)

js (true/false)
if php, boolean data ada 3 (either true, false, or on, off)

null is not equal to 0
loosely-typed 
(in other lang needs to initialize such as C++ = int 1; but js tak perlu)
variable type is not required

slice(0,3) starts from 0 and stop at 3
for(let i = 0; i<3; i++)
//access element
    a[i] //[1, 2, 3]
    3 is not included because 3 is not less than 3 

    js tkde return type (ada identifiers and parentheses)
    php tkde return type

    js = dynamic

PHP

tags <?php...?>

echo == print function
variable in php use $
in php: single quote would be as string 'blabla'

php cannot put in style kot
can put html inside of php

naming convention = can start with $_name (underscore)
javascript use + to concatenate
in php cannot use + to combine variable

Constant variable
define("N", 10);
"N" = variable name
10 = value

Array
Associative array
- key-value pair
- key must be unique (can't duplicate)
Numeric/indexed array

-array - length (guna count())

js - forin
php - foreach

15 March 2023
 make sure key is not duplicate

 Arrays of Array
 Array can be object/Arrays
 -can be multidimensional
 -nested array

 Global variable
 submit form

 should be encrypted.
 if set, means it has data ()
 get data from server ..
 action and method (two attribute on form)

 for loop
 for(;;) - infinite loop
 counter controlled loop - known (declared dkt array)
